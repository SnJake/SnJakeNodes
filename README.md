## üöÄ Installation

You can install this node pack by following this method:

### Method 1: Using Git

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
    ```bash
    # Example for Windows
    cd D:\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\
    
    # Example for Linux/macOS
    cd ~/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```

3.  Clone this repository into the `custom_nodes` folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SnJake/SnJakeNodes.git
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**: Now, you need to install the required Python packages. The command depends on which version of ComfyUI you are using.

    *   **For standard ComfyUI installations (with venv):**
        1.  Make sure your ComfyUI virtual environment (`venv`) is activated.
        2.  Navigate into the new node directory and install the requirements:
            ```bash
            cd SnJakeNodes
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```

    *   **For Portable ComfyUI installations:**
        1.  Navigate back to the **root** of your portable ComfyUI directory (e.g., `D:\ComfyUI_windows_portable`).
        2.  Run the following command to use the embedded Python to install the requirements. *Do not activate any venv.*
            ```bash
            python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r custom_nodes\SnJakeNodes\requirements.txt
            ```

5.  **Restart ComfyUI**: Close the terminal and restart ComfyUI completely. The new `üòé SnJake` nodes will be available in the "Add Node" menu.

## ‚ú® Nodes Included

All nodes can be found in the "Add Node" menu under the **`üòé SnJake/...`** category.

### üé® Pixel Art & Color
- **Pixel Art Effect** (`pixel_art_node.py`): A comprehensive node for creating pixel art with advanced controls for color quantization, dithering, and downscaling.
- **Pixel Art Post Process** (`pixelart_postprocess_node.py`): Applies post-processing effects like palette matching and contour expansion to pixel art images.
- **Segmentation Pixel Art** (`segmentation_pixel_art_node.py`): Creates a stylized pixel art effect using SLIC segmentation to average colors within superpixels.
- **Color Palette** (`color_palette_image_node.py`): Generates a visual image of a color palette from a list of HEX codes.
- **Color Compression** (`color_palette_compression_node.py`): Reduces a given color palette to a smaller, representative set of colors using KMeans clustering.
- **Extract Palette** (`pixel_art_utils.py`): Extracts a color palette from a source image using various quantization methods.
- **Apply Palette (and Dither)** (`pixel_art_utils.py`): Applies a given color palette to an image, with optional dithering.
- **Replace Palette Colors** (`pixel_art_utils.py`): Replaces the colors of an image based on a source and a replacement palette, with sorting options.
- **Color Merge** (`region_merging_node.py`): Merges small, single-color regions in an image into larger neighboring regions to clean up pixel art.

### üîß Utilities & Workflow
- **Batch Load Images** (`utils_nodes.py`): Loads images from a directory with various modes (incremental, random, single).
- **Load Image By Full Path** (`utils_nodes.py`): Loads a single image from an absolute file path.
- **Save Image To Path** (`utils_nodes.py`): Saves an image to a specified absolute path, with an option to embed the workflow.
- **List Image Files In Folder** (`list_image.py`): Scans a folder and outputs a list of full image paths.
- **Simple List Image Files** (`list_image_not.py`): Scans a folder and outputs filenames and full paths as separate multiline strings.
- **Concatenate Images By Directory** (`image_concatenate.py`): Groups images by directory and concatenates them based on a specified base image.
- **Image Mask Selector** (`mask_selector_node.py`): Routes an image to one of two outputs based on whether the input mask is empty or not.
- **Multiline Prompt Selector** (`prompt_selector.py`): Selects a specific line from a multiline text block.
- **Date Time To String** (`datetime_node.py`): Outputs the current date and time as a formatted string, perfect for unique filenames.
- **Route Image By Int** (`utils_nodes.py`): A simple router that directs an image to one of 10 outputs based on an integer input.
- **String->Int/Float** (`utils_nodes.py`): Converts a string to integer and float values.
- **String Replace** (`utils_nodes.py`): Performs a simple find-and-replace operation on a string.
- **Random Int/Float** (`utils_nodes.py`): Generates a random integer or float within a specified range.

### üñºÔ∏è Image Adjustments & Effects
- **Image Adjustment Node** (`color_adjusment.py`): Adjusts temperature, hue, brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma, and midtones.
- **Color Balance** (`color_balance.py`): Provides Lift, Gamma, and Gain controls similar to professional color grading tools.
- **Image Resize Node** (`image_resize_node.py`): A powerful image resizing node with multiple resampling methods, including `bislerp`.
- **CRT Effect** (`crt_effect_node.py`): Simulates a retro Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) monitor effect with scanlines and pixel structure.
- **Liminal Effects Node** (`liminal_effects_node.py`): A multi-effect node for creating eerie, liminal space aesthetics with noise, chromatic aberration, fog, VHS glitches, and more.
- **Expand Image Right** (`expand_image_right.py`): Doubles the width of an image, filling the new right half with white and providing a corresponding mask for outpainting.

### üé≠ Masking & Detailing
- **Custom Mask Node** (`custom_mask_node.py`): Creates a rectangular mask with a specified size, position, and blur on a larger canvas.
- **Sequential Mask Detailer** (`detailer_node.py`): An advanced detailer that processes multiple masks sequentially, applying a KSampler pass to each region for targeted improvements.

### ü§ñ AI & API Integration
- **VLM Api Node** (`api.py`): A Vision-Language Model node that sends an image and a text prompt to an OpenAI-compatible API (like GPT-4o) and returns the text description.
- **AnyNode OpenAI** (`anynode_snjake.py`): A powerful node that takes a user task and input data, sends it to GPT-4o to generate Python code, and executes it.
- **AnyNode Local LLM** (`anynode_snjake.py`): Same as AnyNode, but configured to work with a local OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

### üß™ Experimental & Advanced
- **Lora Loader With Preview** (`lora_loader_preview.py`): A LoRA loader that includes a visual preview of the LoRA's associated image in the ComfyUI interface.
